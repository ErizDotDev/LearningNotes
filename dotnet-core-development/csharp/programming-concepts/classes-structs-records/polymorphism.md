## Versioning with the `override` and `new` keywords

- Derived classes can contain methods with the same name as base class methods:
    - If the method in a derived class is not preceded by the `new` or `override` keywords, the method will still behave as if a `new` keyword was added to the method BUT the compiler will issue a warning.
    - If the method in the derived class is preceded by the `new` keyword, the method is defined as independent of the method in the base class.
        - Additionally, using the `new` keyword hides the base class implementation from the derived class.
            - Does this mean that calling the base class method implementation via `base.MethodCall()` will not work?
    - If the method in the derived class is preceded by the `override` keyword, objects in that class will call that method instead of the method on the base class.
    - A base class method must have the `virtual` keyword to denote that the derived class should override said method.
    - The base class method can be called from within the derived class using the `base` keyword.
    - The `override`, `virtual` and `new` keywords can also be applied to properties, indexers and events.

- By default, C# methods are not virtual.
    

### Override and method selection

- Given the below example:

```csharp
public class Derived : Base
{
	public override void DoWork(int param) {}
	public void DoWork(double param) {}
}
```

- When `DoWork()` is called on an instance of `Derived`, C# compiler will always try to make the call compatible with the versions of `DoWork` declared originally in `Derived`, ergo the `public void DoWork()` method.
- If the C# compiler cannot match the method call from the non override methods of the same name in that class, then thatâ€™s the time it will consider the override methods in that class.
- For example, if `Derived.DoWork()` method was called with an int value parameter, compiler will still call `Derived.DoWork(double)` implementation as the int value can be casted to double.
    - There are a couple of ways to avoid this mistake:
        - Avoid naming non-override methods similar to virtual methods
        - Instruct the C# compiler to call the virtual method by making it search the base class method list.
            - This can happen by casting the Derived class to the Base class which follows the concept of [[contravariance-covariance#^5878ac|contravariance]].
