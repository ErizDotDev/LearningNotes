# üèì Records

- Records are immutable.
- Unlike classes, overriding the `ToString()` method is unnecessary as the language innately provides a behavior for records to display values of a record‚Äôs properties.
- Can inherit from another record but it cannot inherit from a class.

### When to use

- Comparing data based on value equality
    - **Value Equality** - Data are equal if they are of the same type, and their property values are congruent with one another.
    - Classes follow the reference equality. **Reference equality** check if both data came from the same reference object.
- If you‚Äôre not using Entity Framework Core.

## Inheritance behavior

### Equality

- In cases where records are inherited, two records are deemed as equal if both have the same runtime type.
	- Does not matter if the records match type on compile time.
	- Example:

```csharp

public record Motorcycle(string Make, string Model);
public record Scooter(string Make, string Model, string Color) : Motorcycle(Make, Model);

Motorcycle mc = new Motorcycle("Harley", "Lowrider");
Motorcycle sc = new Scooter("Harley", "Lowrider");

```

### Deconstruction

- Deconstruction will not include extra properties of a derived type if the type used is the base type.
	- Casting the object to the derive type will allow the deconstruction operation.

### Review Notes

- On this given link, [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/records) there is a code block here that looks like this.

```csharp
var phoneNumbers = new string[2];
var person1 = new Person("Denzel", "dela Cruz", phoneNumbers);
var person2 = new Person("Denzel", "dela Cruz", phoneNumbers);
Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2);

person1.PhoneNumbers[0] = "+63 918 123 4567";
Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2);
```

The last line of code will result to True. My initial assumption was that it should be False, because the phone number was only assigned to person1 `PhoneNumbers` object. After diving deep, the reason why the expression reconciled to true is because an array is a reference type, adding to that the same `phoneNumbers` array was assigned to both person1 and person2 records. Any changes made to an array will automatically be copied to any objects that has a reference to that array, simply because an array is a reference type.

- Another code block that I need to review is this

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(person1, person2));
```

This particular expression reconciles to a value of False. Objects person1 and person2 are different objects as displayed on the first screenshot in this section. Both are different instances of the record Person, although both share the same property values. The method `ReferenceEquals()` evaluate if two objects share the same instance or not. Since person1 and person2 are instantiated separately, `ReferenceEquals()` will result to a false value.
