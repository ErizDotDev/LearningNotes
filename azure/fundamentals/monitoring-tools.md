    - **Service Health**
        - Provides a personalized view of status of the Azure regions youâ€™re in and Azure services youâ€™re using.
        - Best place to get information about planned maintenance, outages and other health advisories to the services that youâ€™re specifically using.
        - Alerts and notifications can be configured to let you know once these health advisories start to circulate to users.
    - **Resource Health**
        - Provides a view on the health of your specific resources (specific VM instances, database servers, app functions, etc.)
        - Alerts and configurations based on availability changes.
- Historical alerts are available for viewing at any time.

## Azure Monitor

- Platform for collecting data on your resources, visualizing the data that was uncovered, like a personal dashboard of data about your Azure resources.

- Collection of notification and action preferences that you associate with one or more alerts
- Hereâ€™s where we determine who will be sent out with a notification.

### Application Insights

- Monitors web applications that are hosted either in Azure, on-prem or multi-cloud environments.
- Two ways to use Application Insights:
    - Through SDK available in most programming languages
    - Application Insights agent - application running inside your environment
- Monitors metrics like:
    - Hardware stats like CPU, memory and network usage
    - Numbers of requests, response times, failure rates
    - User and session counts
    - and many more
- Can also send dummy requests to check the status and monitor your application during periods of low activity.
