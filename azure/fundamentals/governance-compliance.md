## Azure Policy

- Azure service that helps you create, assign and manage policies that control or audit your resources.
    - Policies enforce different rules across all of your resource configurations in order to maintain the compliance of these configurations to standards.

### How does Azure Policy define policies?

- Enables the definition of individual policies and groups of policies, aka **initiatives**.
- Evaluates your resources then highlights resources that are not up to standard.
- Prevents non-compliant resources from being created.
- Policies can be set on every level (resources, resource groups, subscription, etc.) and are inherited based on policies set on the level above the target assignment.
- Different Azure services have built in policy and initiative definitions
    - If a policy is created that only allows a certain size of VM to be used in your environment, that policy is invoked when creating new VMs and evaluating VMs that are created before the policy is created.
- Azure Policy automatically fixes resources and configurations that are non-compliant to the policies.
    - Example: A certain group does not have a certain tag which according to a policy all resources should have. Azure Policy fixes that by automatically adding that tag.
    - You can choose to exempt some resources from this auto-fix feature by flagging them as exceptions to the policy.
- Integrates with ADO (Azure DevOps) to enforce standards on pre and post deployment phase of maintained applications.

### Initiatives

- Way of grouping related policies together.
- Example: There is a policy named Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center whose goal is to monitor security recommendations for all resources in Security Center.
    - Under this initiative are the following policies:
        - Monitor unencrypted SQL databases
        - Monitor OS vulnerabilities
        - Monitor missing Endpoint protection
        - And there are hundreds more...

## Resource Locks

- Prevents resources from accidentally being deleted or updated
    - Even with RBAC policies in place, some person high in the organization with all access can still update or delete crucial resources.
- Applies at every Azure resource level and can also be inherited like policies.
- Resource lock types:
    - Delete
    - ReadOnly
- Resource locks are managed at the Settings tab of each resource
- To modify a locked resource, follow this two-step process:
    - Remove lock
    - Apply any action that your account is allowed to do.
